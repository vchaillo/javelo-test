# Level 4 : Top level objectives

Objectives can be children of other objectives. We say they have a parent objective.

The theoric achievement of a parent objective is deduced from its children: at a certain date it is the mean of the theoric accomplishement of its children objectives, taking into account some coefficients.

The start and end values of these parent objectives are also computed thanks to their children and corresponding coefficients.
