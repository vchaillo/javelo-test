# Intro

In this test, you are going to work on objectives, the main feature of javelo!

An objective represents a task that a user should accomply within a certain amount of time.

This feature aims to help these users planify well those tasks, and track their progression in order to accomplish them smoothly and on time.

Example of a real life objective:
```
{
  id: 17548,
  title: "Make 50 blank tests to be trained for the javelo challenge",
  start: 0,
  start_date: '2017-12-01',
  end_date: '2018-09-31',
  target: 50,
  unit: 'number'
}
```

# Level 1 : Achivement in percentage

In this level, we'll focus on some records of objective's progress. For each one you should compute the corresponding `progress` value.

Progress is the objective's percentage achieved the value of the `progress_record` represents.
