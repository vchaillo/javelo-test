# Level 3 : Milestones

Sometimes users need more control over the theoric achievement of an objective, and the 2 starting and ending points are not enough.
A milestone is a (time, value) point defining where the real achievement curve should pass. By using milestones, users can define better how they should complete their objectives over time between the starting and ending points.

The theoric achievement between milestones (and between a milestone and one of the start or end point) is linear.

The excess is computed using the theoric achievement at the date of a record, the value of this record and the starting point.
