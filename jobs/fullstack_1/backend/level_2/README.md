# Level 2 : Temporal progression

In order to help people achieve their objectives, start and end dates are furnished.

Objectives are expected to be completed linearly during these dates.

Each record is now dated. Meaning its value can be compared to the expected completion of the corresponding objective at that date.

The `excess` is the difference between thos two values, in percentage of the expected completion.
