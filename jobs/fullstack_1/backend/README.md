# Javelo Backend challenge

- for each level, write code that generates a `data/output.json` file from `data/input.json`.
- an `expected_output.json` file is available to give you a reference on what result is expected.
- running `$ ruby main.rb` from the level folder should generate the desired output, but of course feel free to add more files if needed.
