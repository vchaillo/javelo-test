# Javelo Fullstack challenge 1


## Guidelines

You will find 2 parts in this challenge: backend and frontend. They are not related, each one can be solved independenlty. Resolve them in any order.

- Clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- Solve the levels in ascending order (for each part)
- Only do one commit per level

## Pointers

On each part, you can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the simplest thing that could work for the level you're currently solving.

The levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements.
A good way to solve this is by using OOP, adding new layers of abstraction when they become necessary and possibly write tests so you don't break what you have already done.

Don't hesitate to write [shameless code](http://red-badger.com/blog/2014/08/20/i-spent-3-days-with-sandi-metz-heres-what-i-learned/) at first, and then refactor it in the next levels.

For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is clean, extensible and robust, so don't overlook edge cases, use exceptions where needed, ...

## Contact

- You should already be in contact with a the Javelo team member, don't hesitate to ask if something seems wrong
- When you are done, send the link of your repository to this contact

Good luck!
